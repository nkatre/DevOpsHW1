# HW #1 Provisioning Servers

Automatically provisioning a computational resource will be one of the most important skills for you to master in your career.  You have gained experience using [digitalocean](https://developers.digitalocean.com/v2/) to automatically create virtual images on a hosted server. 

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)

AWS is a rich computation platform for supporting many services. The goal of your homework assignment is to create  account with AWS, learn how to use its API, and perform a simple task with the service.

AWS provides a [free tier plan](http://aws.amazon.com/free/), for 12 months, which is appropriate for learning the platform.

Completing this homework will be essential for the remaining of the semester.

### Components

After creating an account, please read [this guide](https://d36cz9buwru1tt.cloudfront.net/AWS_Overview.pdf), in order to get an overview of the platform provided.  After reading this document (or others that you find), prepare a simple paragraph describing a service that you learned about. Next, please review the different ways of interfacing with the [AWS API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/making-api-requests.html).  It is possible to use simple http requests, or you can also use language binding for the API (e.g. Java, .NET, ruby, javascript, etc.).

After reviewing how you would like to connect to AWS, create a simple program that will 
* Authenicate to AWS
* Demonstrate a simple API call.

After completing your program, write a simple description of what you did, and include a screenshot demonstrating your API call.

### Submission

Create a github repository (on github proper or NCSU), place your paragraph, screenshot, and API demonstration  in a README.md file.  Please refer to this [Markdown guide](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) if you are not familiar with the syntax.

Please email your TA with the link to your repository in order to submit.

The assignment is due Friday, Jan 23rd at midnight.
