# HW #1 Question

Create a simple program that will

Part I. Authenicate to AWS    
Part II. Demonstrate a simple API call.

After completing your program, write a simple description of what you did, and include a screenshot demonstrating your API call.

# Solution

Soltution File: SimpleQueueServiceSample.java

## Paragraph
<p>
Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a distributed queue system which allows different types of web services applications to reliably queue message generated by one component of the application which woud then be consumed by some other components.
<p>
Thus a AWS SQS queue would act as a simple repository for messages which are awaiting processing and which can be used by different components for passing information to each other.
<p>
Using AWS SQS, data can be moved between different components of any application that can perform different tasks, without losing messages or requiring each component to be always available.
<p>
The AWS SQS can solves the problems where the producer component of the appication is producing messages faster than the consumer who can process it.
<p>
A single Queue in AWS SQS can be used simultaneously by many distributed application components with no requirement for these components to first co-ordinate with each other to share the queue.
<p>
One of the trade-offs in SQS is that it does not gaurantee first in first out delivery of messages. For many applications each message can stand on its own, the order of the messages is not important. If in case any application requires order to be preserved, in such cases sequencing information can be stored and send with each message, so that the receiving component can reorder the messages to preserve the order.


## Description Paragraph
This sample demonstrates how to make basic requests to Amazon SQS using the AWS SDK for Java.
<p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> You must have a valid Amazon Web
Services developer account, and be signed up to use Amazon SQS. For more
information on Amazon SQS, see http://aws.amazon.com/sqs.
<p>
Fill in your AWS access credentials in the provided credentials file
template, and be sure to move the file to the default location
(~/.aws/credentials) [Linux system] where the sample code will load the credentials from.
<p>
<b>WANRNING:</b> To avoid accidental leakage of your credentials, DO NOT keep
the credentials file in your source directory.    
</p>

### Part I. Authentication to AWS
<p>The ProfileCredentialsProvider class will return your [default] credential profile by reading from the credentials file located at (~/.aws/credentials)
<p>The obtained credentials are then used to authenticate to AmazonSQS using AmazonSQSClient class. The authentication is done using AmazonSQSClient(credentials)
constructor.

### Part II. Demonstration of AmazonSQS (Amazon Simple Queue Service) API call
<p>To demonstrate the API call to AmazonSQS, I have implemented the following methods:

1.  Authenticate to AWS
2.  Create a new SQS queue called MyQueue
3.  Listing all queues in your account.
4.  Sending a message to MyQueue
5.  Receiving messages from MyQueue
6.  Deleting a message
7.  Deleting the test queue
